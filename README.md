# Scheduling-Assistant

##Description

Plan your day with ease using this work day scheduler. Save what you input and it will be available to you the whole day even if you close your browser. Notice the colors in the calendar. Grey indicates time that has already passed, red indicates the current hour, and green in time available to plan.
